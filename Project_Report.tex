\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{To properly define this term â€” a markup language is a language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate that text. Most markup languages are human-readable because the annotations are written in a way to distinguish them from the text itself. For example, with HTML, XML, and XHTML.}{\fontsize{11pt}{13.2pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{ \par}Here in this work, we are basically concentrating on HTML dialect.}\par

	\item {\fontsize{14pt}{16.8pt}\selectfont \textbf{\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{IDE}}\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{An IDE generally contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a computer program, accessed through one graphical computer program (GUI). The user writes and edits ASCII text file within the code editor. The compiler interprets the ASCII text file into a decipherable language thatâ€™s feasible for a pc. and therefore the computer program tests the computer code to resolve any problems or bugs.}\par

\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{There are many IDE Available like NetBeans, Eclipse, CodeBlocks, Visual Studio etc.}\par

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{In computer programming â€” which includes Markup Languages â€” there are generally two types of errors with code:}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Syntax errors â€” these errors usually involve a mistake that causes the computer to be unable to execute or compile the program properly (e.g., a missing brace or parenthesis).}}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Logic errors â€” these errors arise when the code is syntactically correct but doesnâ€™t do exactly what it was meant to do.}}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{With most programming languages, the first kind of error is impossible to overlook. The code will refuse to compile or run until the error is fixed, and the compiler will usually alert the programmer to the error and the line number on which it can be found.}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{This makes finding and fixing syntax errors much easier than logic errors, which result in those general head-scratching moments of, $``$Why isnâ€™t it doing what I want?$"$  Validators, as you might expect, can only find syntax errors.}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Although HTML is a declarative Markup language rather than a procedural programming language, syntax errors may still occur. However, syntax errors in a web page do not commonly cause the web browser to refuse to display the page. This inherent forgiveness in web browsers is one of the biggest reasons for the rapid adoption and spread of the web. Even if you forget to close a tag, your page will usually still display.}\par

\setlength{\parskip}{5.04pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Missing quotation marks for attribute values.\\
Though older versions of HTML do not require that you surround values with quotations marks, future versions (including XHTML) will. Though you can get away with making this mistake in most browsers, placing quotes around values is suggested.\\
Examples of what NOT to do:\\
<img src=myimage.gif>\\
<font color=$\#$ FF00FF>\\
<p style=font-face: arial, geneva>}\par

	\item \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Missing closing tags\\
Most HTML tags have both an opening and closing tag (i.e., <b> and </b>). If a tag mark's up or surrounds any other content, then it must be closed. One exception to this is the <p> tag. XHTML (which we'll talk about later) requires that ALL tags be closed. I recommend closing the <p> tag, even if it is not required now. This usually makes editing your HTML easier as well.}\par

\setlength{\parskip}{12.0pt}
	\item \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Improper nesting of HTML tags.\\
HTML tags must be closed in the opposite order than which they were opened. I like to draw imaginary arching lines from matching opening and closing tags. If any of the lines cross, then you have probably nested improperly.}\par

\vspace{\baselineskip} \tabto{0.59in} \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Server resources tie closely to three specific types of hardware: hard disk storage; CPU sizeâ€”number of cores, and to a lesser extent, clock speed; and the capacity of on-board server memory (RAM). A file server will have multiple bays for hard drives since itâ€™s primarily used for storage. A database server that handles lots of user queries benefits from a large (12- or 16-core) CPU. Web servers and application servers have framework-specific requirements you might reference, usually the number of users querying or writing to the database aï¬€ects how robust you should go with the hardware.}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{\uline{How to pick the right server for the job}}\par

{\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{So, getting back to that initial questionâ€”\textit{what will your server actually do}? A business buys a server to handle one or more specific tasks:}\par}\par

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Sharing assets with file server, or network attached storage (NAS) appliance across a local network or as so-called private cloud storage. Look for: multiple hot-swappable drive bays, configurable hardware/software RAID options; a low- power CPU should suï¬ƒce.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Providing authentication for a domain. Username, password, levels of access, and security settings resides in a designated server computer or network switch.

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Providing database services to other servers. Applications and websites are built upon a database layer which is often stored on its own server. Development and non-user specific tasks like data analysis, mining, archiving, and storage using Oracle, MySQL, MS Access, and similar applications utilizes this server hardware. Look for: hard drives rated for fast writes; deploy an identical backup â€˜slaveâ€™ server as a read-only database.}\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Hosting a website with a web server. Web servers use HTTP to serve files that make up web pages served to users browsing a website. Web servers work in tandem with a database server. This may occur within the same physical hardware server, or by using two servers networked together. Look for: hardware redundancy especially if you host e-commerce. Increasing server RAM capacity benefits performance under load.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Providing e-mail services with a mail server. Messaging servers, like Microsoft Exchange, use specific protocols (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) to send and receive messages. Dedicating server hardware to this task is recommend for optimal operation. Look for: similar specifications as a file server.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Controlling shared peripheral equipment, like a printer. Low-power specs will suï¬ƒce. You might repurpose and old PC as a print server if you have one.}\par}\par

\vspace{\baselineskip}\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{\uline{Choosing server form factor to fit your physical space}}\par

\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Servers come in several diï¬€erent physical form factors that can be classified into three umbrellas: tower, blade, and rackmount. The form factors are determined by the server case; youâ€™ll find the same components on the inside of comparable models.}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Tower â€“ A tower server resembles a regular desktop computersâ€”except that they have server components inside. Same as their PC cousins, towers come in several diï¬€erent shapes. These make sense as first servers because they can oï¬€er plenty of processing power and donâ€™t require you to purchase additional mounting hardware. The drawback of tower servers is that they take up more room than either rackmount or blade setups once you start adding more.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Rackmount â€“Rackmount servers need to be installed onto a rack chassis. A chassis, typically several feet high, can hold multiple servers on top of each other in slots.

\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{You will typically find 2 types of websites:}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Static or Basic Websites: Static websites are simple websites with one or more web pages (called HTML pages). You can build them on your computer with software like Dreamweaver and then upload the pages to your hostâ€™s server using any FTP software (such as FileZilla).Whenever you need to make changes to your website, youâ€™ll have to edit the pages on your computer and upload them again. Since they cannot be modified dynamically, such websites are called static websites.Static websites are cheaper than dynamic websites (below) but come with limited functionality and no option for e- commerce or interactivity.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Dynamic Websites: Dynamic websites contain information that changes, depending on the time of day, the viewer and other factors. They make use of both client-side and server-side scripts to create and update content. Client- side scripts, which run on a userâ€™s computer, are mainly used for appearance and interaction purposes. Server-side scripts, which reside on a server and are extensively used by E-commerce and social networking sites, allow users to have individual accounts and provide a customised response for each user. Dynamic websites are CMS-driven, and allow you to directly add and edit content (i.e. text, design, photos, and videos), as well as let your visitors leave comments and start discussions.Dynamic websites are ideal for businesses and organisations. Examples of dynamic websites include blogs, forums, photo galleries and e-commerce sites.}\par}\par

\vspace{\baselineskip}\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{\uline{Step 2: Choose Your Hosting Server}}\par

\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Unlike\ static\ HTML sites which can be hosted on most web servers, when it   comes to web applications, there are basically two types of hosting platforms. Depending on your hosting needs and what youâ€™re most comfortable with, you can choose from:}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Linux Hosting, which allows running scripts written in PHP, Perl, Python and other Unix-originated languages, and usually supports PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. This is the most commonly used system today.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Windows Hosting, which allows running ASP scripts utilizing .NET and other Microsoft technologies, and supports Microsoft SQL Server and Access database.}\par}\par

\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{You can go with either Linux hosting or Windows hosting, regardless of which operating system you use at home or at work. If your website doesnâ€™t require any scripting support, youâ€™ll find Linux hosting more cost-eï¬€ective. But if your website needs scripting and database support, choose the platform that supports the technologies you use.}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{\uline{Step 3: Select Your Web Hosting Plan}}\par

\textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{You will typically find a wide range of services in web hosting, such as:}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Shared Hosting: In shared hosting, you get to share the physical server with other website owners. However, you will have your own separate account (secured with login credentials). Shared hosting is very aï¬€ordable because the cost of operating the server is shared between you and the other website owners.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{VPS Hosting (Virtual Private Server Hosting): In VPS hosting, every website is stored on a very powerful server that is divided into several virtual compartments. The server software is configured separately so that each unit can function independently. It should be your preferred option if you have high-security concerns but donâ€™t want to invest in a faster (but costlier) dedicated server.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Dedicated Hosting: Dedicated hosting oï¬€ers you an entire server for yourself, thereby making it faster, more secure$ \ldots $ and costlier. It is the ideal solution for larger businesses and high-traï¬ƒc websites because it allows for maximum customisation, configuration, installation and flexibility.}\par}\par

	\item {\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont \textcolor[HTML]{0D0D0D}{Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting allows multiple virtual servers (clouds) to work together to host a website or a group of websites. It oï¬€ers unlimited ability to handle sudden traï¬ƒc spikes. A cloud-hosted website is not limited to a single server, and the resources allocated to it can shrink or expand dynamically, depending on how much traï¬ƒc you get.
